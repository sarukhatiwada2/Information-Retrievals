NASA LAUNCHES ESCAPADE MISSION: TWIN SPACECRAFT HEAD TO MARS TO UNLOCK ATMOSPHERIC MYSTERIES

Cape Canaveral - On November 13, 2025, NASA successfully launched the ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission, deploying twin spacecraft on a journey to Mars to investigate one of the Red Planet's most profound mysteries: how it lost its once-thick atmosphere and transformed into the barren desert world we see today.

The mission, led by the University of California, Berkeley, lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station aboard Blue Origin's New Glenn orbital rocket. This launch represents a significant milestone not only for planetary science but also for commercial spaceflight, as New Glenn successfully completed its maiden voyage carrying a NASA science payload.

The ESCAPADE mission consists of two identical spacecraft that will work in tandem to study how solar wind—the constant stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun—interacts with Mars' magnetic environment. Unlike Earth, which possesses a strong global magnetic field that shields our planet from solar radiation, Mars lost its global magnetic field billions of years ago, leaving its atmosphere vulnerable to erosion by solar particles.

Scientists believe that ancient Mars once had a thick atmosphere capable of supporting liquid water on its surface. Geological evidence including dried river beds, ancient lake deposits, and valley networks suggests that water flowed freely on the Martian surface approximately 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. Understanding how Mars lost this atmosphere is crucial not only for piecing together the planet's climatic history but also for assessing the potential for past life and informing future human exploration efforts.

The twin spacecraft will employ a unique measurement approach, positioning themselves at different locations around Mars simultaneously. This coordinated observation strategy will allow scientists to capture a comprehensive, three-dimensional picture of how solar wind strips away atmospheric particles. Previous missions have provided valuable data, but ESCAPADE's dual-spacecraft configuration will enable unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of these dynamic processes.

Dr. Robert Lillis, principal investigator for ESCAPADE at UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory, explains that the mission will focus on several key scientific objectives. The primary goal is to understand the processes controlling the structure and variability of Mars' magnetosphere—the region of space dominated by the planet's remnant magnetic fields and its interaction with solar wind.

The spacecraft will measure how energy and momentum from the solar wind are transferred to the Martian atmosphere and how this energy drives atmospheric escape. By tracking ions as they are accelerated away from Mars, ESCAPADE will quantify the rate at which the planet continues to lose its atmosphere today and help scientists extrapolate these processes backward through billions of years of Martian history.

Each ESCAPADE spacecraft is equipped with a comprehensive suite of scientific instruments designed to measure plasma, magnetic fields, and energetic particles. The magnetometer will map the complex magnetic field environment around Mars, while plasma instruments will detect the composition, density, temperature, and velocity of charged particles in different regions of the Martian space environment.

Energetic particle detectors will measure high-energy ions and electrons accelerated by various processes, helping scientists understand the mechanisms that drive atmospheric escape. Together, these instruments will provide a detailed picture of the physical processes occurring in Mars' upper atmosphere and ionosphere.

The launch was briefly delayed by a severe geomagnetic storm that occurred in early November 2025. These solar storms, ironically caused by the same solar processes that ESCAPADE will study at Mars, can disrupt spacecraft electronics and create hazardous radiation environments. Mission controllers decided to wait for the storm to subside, ensuring the safest possible conditions for the spacecraft during their critical early operations phase.

The choice of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket for this mission marks an important development in NASA's strategy of leveraging commercial launch capabilities for science missions. New Glenn, a heavy-lift orbital rocket designed for reusability, demonstrated its capability to deliver payloads beyond low Earth orbit, opening new possibilities for future planetary missions.

The data gathered by ESCAPADE will have implications extending far beyond Mars. Understanding atmospheric escape processes is crucial for assessing the habitability of exoplanets around other stars. Many potentially habitable exoplanets are located close to their host stars, where they would be subjected to intense stellar radiation and particle bombardment. Lessons learned from Mars' atmospheric evolution can help scientists predict which exoplanets might retain their atmospheres over geological timescales.

ESCAPADE's observations will also complement data from other spacecraft currently studying Mars, including NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) mission, which has been investigating atmospheric escape since 2014. The European Space Agency's Mars Express and the United Arab Emirates' Hope probe have also contributed valuable data about Mars' upper atmosphere and climate.

The mission is expected to continue for at least one Martian year (approximately two Earth years), providing coverage across different seasons and varying solar conditions. This duration will allow scientists to observe how atmospheric escape rates change with seasonal variations in solar illumination and during different phases of the solar activity cycle.

NASA emphasized that the knowledge gained from ESCAPADE will be essential for planning future human exploration of Mars. Understanding the current rate of atmospheric loss and the environmental conditions in Mars' upper atmosphere will help engineers design systems to protect astronauts from radiation and support long-duration human presence on the Red Planet.

The successful launch of ESCAPADE also provides valuable performance data for Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, which NASA may utilize for future missions under the agency's Commercial Launch Services contracts. The partnership between NASA and commercial launch providers is transforming how the agency conducts space exploration, enabling more frequent missions at lower costs.

As ESCAPADE begins its months-long cruise to Mars, the mission team is conducting systems checks and calibrating instruments in preparation for arrival at the Red Planet. Upon reaching Mars, the twin spacecraft will enter orbit and begin their coordinated observations, marking the beginning of a new chapter in our understanding of planetary atmospheric evolution.

Dr. Lillis concluded, "ESCAPADE represents a crucial step in understanding not just Mars, but the broader processes that shape planetary atmospheres throughout our solar system and beyond. The answers we seek about Mars' past will help us understand the conditions necessary for life elsewhere in the universe."

The data collected by ESCAPADE will be made available to the global scientific community through NASA's Planetary Data System, ensuring that researchers worldwide can contribute to unlocking the secrets of Mars' atmospheric history and its implications for planetary science.
